# RISC-V-Tapeout-RTL-to-GDSII
The RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program is a 20-week hands-on course guiding participants from RTL design to fabricated silicon. It covers synthesis, physical design, timing sign-off, verification, and chip validation using a 180 nm process. Blending online learning and labs, it offers end-to-end experience in RISC-V SoC development and tape-out.
